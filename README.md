**HitPay Recurring Payments** is a payment gateway plugin that extends [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com) and
[WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) allowing HitPay merchants to accept payments using:
- PayNow QR.
- Cards.
- Apple Pay.
- Google Pay. 
- WeChatPay.
- AliPay.
- GrabPay.

## Subscriptions
The plugin has [subscription support](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), so you can create and manage products with automatic recurring payments.

Here's the [store manager guide](https://woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/store-manager-guide/) on how to use subscription features with your WooCommerce store.
